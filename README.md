# GameSorting Web App

This is a simple web application to make list of whishes and sort them. You can access the website [here](https://gamesorting.bluedragon28.com).

The structure of the app is divided into seperate sections. The collections, the lists and finally the items. The collections is representing the main theme (ex: Games, Books...). The lists are dividing a theme in actions (ex: Wanted, Not wanted, Played...). The items are the elements representing a wish (or not) (ex: a game, a book...).

One of the best feature of the app is the ability of add customs data. You add custom column to a whole list and after that a custom input will be available in the new/edit page for each items of the list.

I hope you will like this application.
